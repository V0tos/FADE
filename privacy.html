<h1>FADE – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 5 February 2026</p>

<p>Fade respects your privacy and is committed to handling personal data responsibly and transparently.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used, and how users can delete their data. By using the Fade mobile application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Fade only collects information necessary to provide its features.</p>

<h3>A. Images You Upload</h3>
<p>We collect images that you voluntarily upload, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face photos</li>
<li>Hair scans</li>
<li>Haircut scans</li>
<li>Product scans</li>
<li>Progress images</li>
<li>Images uploaded within AskFade for analysis or guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>Images are used solely to generate AI-based analysis, scores, and recommendations within the app.</p>

<h3>B. Onboarding Information</h3>
<p>During onboarding, we collect information you choose to provide, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Where you found Fade</li>
<li>Hair goals and preferences</li>
<li>Style interests</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is used to personalise recommendations and improve user experience. Fade does not use onboarding data for advertising profiling or sale.</p>

<h3>C. Scan Results & Progress Data</h3>
<p>We store AI-generated scan results, scores, improvement estimates, and progress tracking data over time to allow users to track changes and trends.</p>

<h3>D. AskFade Inputs</h3>
<p>When using AskFade, we collect text prompts and images submitted for guidance. These inputs are used only to generate AI-based responses and are not used for advertising.</p>

<h3>E. Usage & Technical Data</h3>
<p>We may collect limited technical and usage data such as feature interactions, app performance data, and error logs. This data is used only to maintain and improve functionality.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Analyse images using AI</li>
<li>Generate haircut and styling guidance</li>
<li>Respond to AskFade requests</li>
<li>Track progress over time</li>
<li>Improve performance and reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your data for unrelated purposes.</p>

<h2>3. What We Do NOT Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell personal data or images</li>
<li>Share images with advertisers</li>
<li>Use images for identity verification</li>
<li>Use images for biometric identification</li>
<li>Judge, label, or identify individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Images are analysed only to calculate visual proportions and traits, not to determine identity or worth.</p>

<h2>4. Image Consent & User Responsibility</h2>
<p>Users must only upload images of themselves or others where explicit consent has been obtained. Uploading images without consent is prohibited and may result in account termination.</p>

<h2>5. AI Processing & Accuracy</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI outputs are predictive and probabilistic</li>
<li>Results may be inaccurate or incomplete</li>
<li>Outputs are informational, not guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>Fade makes reasonable efforts to improve accuracy but does not promise perfect results.</p>

<h2>6. Who We Share Data With</h2>
<p>We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the app (e.g. cloud hosting and AI processing). We do not sell or rent your data. Data may be disclosed if required by law.</p>

<h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your data may be processed outside your country of residence. We take steps to protect it in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h2>8. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect user data. No system is completely secure.</p>

<h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain data only while your account remains active or as required to provide functionality.</p>

<h2>10. Data Deletion & User Control</h2>
<p>Users may permanently delete all stored data via Settings → Delete My Data. Once deleted, data cannot be recovered.</p>

<h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, portability, objection, and withdrawal of consent. Contact: fadeapporg@gmail.com</p>

<h2>12. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>Deleting your data disables your account. Subscriptions must be cancelled separately through your app store.</p>

<h2>13. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Payments are handled by platforms such as Apple App Store or Google Play. Fade does not collect card details. We may receive limited subscription status information to manage access.</p>

<h2>14. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Fade relies on third-party services for distribution, payments, and cloud processing. These operate under their own policies.</p>

<h2>15. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Fade is not intended for users under 13. If you believe data has been collected from a child under 13, contact us.</p>

<h2>16. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. Continued use of Fade constitutes acceptance of updates.</p>
