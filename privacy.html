<h1>FADE – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 28 February 2026</p>

<p>Fade respects your privacy and is committed to handling personal data responsibly and transparently.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used, and how users can delete their data. By using the Fade mobile application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>5. AI Processing & Accuracy</h2>

<h2>6. Who We Share Data With</h2>
<p>We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the app, including:</p>

<h2>8. Data Storage & Security</h2>

<h2>9. Data Retention</h2>

<h2>10. Data Deletion & User Control</h2>
<p>Users may permanently delete all stored data via Settings → Delete My Data. Once deleted, data cannot be recovered.</p>

<h2>11. Facial Data & Biometric Information</h2>
<p>Fade collects user-submitted facial photographs (front and side selfies) when users initiate scans or upload progress images.</p>
<p>These images are used exclusively to analyse facial proportions, symmetry, structural characteristics, and hair traits to generate personalised recommendations.</p>
<p>Fade does not perform facial recognition, identity verification, surveillance, or biometric identification. We do not create biometric templates for identifying individuals.</p>
<p>Facial images are transmitted securely to OpenAI for analysis and stored within Supabase cloud infrastructure to enable personalisation and progress tracking.</p>
<p>Facial data is retained while the account remains active and is permanently deleted when the user selects “Delete My Data.”</p>
<p>Facial data is never sold, rented, or shared with advertisers.</p>

<h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may have rights including access, correction, deletion, portability, objection, and withdrawal of consent.</p>

<h2>13. Account Deletion</h2>

<h2>15. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Third-party services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>
