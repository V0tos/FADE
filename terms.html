<h1>FADE – Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 5 February 2026</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Fade mobile application, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

<h2>1. What Fade Does</h2>
<p>Fade is an AI-powered grooming and appearance guidance application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Haircut and hairstyle recommendations</li>
<li>Hair styling guidance</li>
<li>Hair product analysis and suggestions</li>
<li>Appearance and hair-related scans</li>
<li>Progress tracking over time</li>
<li>Improvement guidance based on AI analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Fade analyses visual proportions, patterns, and traits to produce AI-generated scores and guidance. It assists and guides — it does not promise outcomes.</p>

<h2>2. How Fade Uses AI</h2>
<p>Fade uses artificial intelligence to analyse images and inputs. AI outputs are predictions, not certainties. Results may be inaccurate or incomplete and depend on many external factors. Outcomes are not guaranteed.</p>

<h2>3. No Responsibility for Expected Results</h2>
<p>If you do not achieve expected results, this is not Fade's responsibility and does not entitle you to a refund. Use of Fade does not guarantee improvement.</p>

<h2>4. Improvement Estimates & Paywall Information</h2>
<p>Estimated improvement potential and projections are AI-generated predictions, not promises. Purchasing premium features does not ensure results.</p>

<h2>5. Haircut & Styling Guidance</h2>
<p>Final results depend on barber execution, tools, technique, and individual hair characteristics. Outcomes may differ from AI guidance.</p>

<h2>6. Product Analysis & Recommendations</h2>
<p>Product recommendations are informational only. Effects vary by individual. Fade does not replace professional advice.</p>

<h2>7. Scans, Scores & Progress Tracking</h2>
<p>Scores and scans are AI-generated estimates influenced by lighting, angles, and conditions. They are directional tools, not precise measurements.</p>

<h2>8. User Content & Consent</h2>
<p>You may upload images including face photos and hair scans. By uploading content, you confirm ownership or explicit consent.</p>
<p>Uploading images without consent, harassment, or abuse may result in suspension or permanent ban.</p>

<h2>9. Eligibility (Age)</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Fade. If under 18, parental review is recommended. Accounts not meeting eligibility may be terminated.</p>

<h2>10. Abuse, Illegal Use & Hacking</h2>
<p>You agree not to upload illegal content, harass others, attempt to hack, exploit, or reverse engineer the app. Violations may result in termination.</p>

<h2>11. Account Suspension, Bans & Refunds</h2>
<p>If suspended or banned for violating these Terms, no refunds will be issued and access may be permanently terminated.</p>

<h2>12. Payments, Subscriptions & Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Subscriptions may include Weekly ($4.99), Monthly ($9.99), and Yearly ($31.99) plans. Prices may vary by region.</p>
<p>All payments are non-refundable except where required by law. Refunds are not provided for dissatisfaction, incorrect expectations, inaccurate predictions, bans, or change of mind. Purchases are subject to app store policies.</p>
<p>Cancellation stops future billing but does not refund past charges.</p>

<h2>13. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of uploaded content. You grant Fade a limited license to process it to provide services. Fade retains ownership of its technology, branding, and design.</p>

<h2>14. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Fade relies on third-party services such as AI providers, cloud storage, and app stores. Their services operate under their own policies.</p>

<h2>15. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>Fade is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Fade is not liable for indirect or consequential damages. Total liability shall not exceed the amount paid in the 12 months prior to a claim, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>17. Agreement Not to Sue</h2>
<p>You agree not to bring claims for dissatisfaction with AI results or predictions, except where rights cannot legally be waived.</p>

<h2>18. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Fade from claims arising from your use, breach of these Terms, violation of law, or uploaded content.</p>

<h2>19. Data Storage & Deletion</h2>
<p>Fade stores uploaded images, scan results, onboarding data, and progress history. Data may be permanently deleted via Settings → Delete My Data.</p>

<h2>20. Termination by You</h2>
<p>You may stop using Fade at any time. Subscription cancellation stops future billing but does not refund past payments.</p>

<h2>21. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>Fade may update these Terms. Continued use constitutes acceptance of changes.</p>

<h2>22. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision is invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>

<h2>23. Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Fade.</p>

<h2>24. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>
